## About The Project

Who Are You? allows you to detect and recognize faces in real-time. Check out the repository files to find the labels, trainer and faces used as well as the application code. 

### Developed Using
This project was developed in Python using the following modules:
* [OpenCV](https://docs.opencv.org/4.5.2/d6/d00/tutorial_py_root.html)
* [NumPy](https://numpy.org)
* [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
* [Pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html)
* [OS](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html)

## Screenshots

Demo screenshots using two faces can be seen below.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To use this bot, some packages need to be installed, download these packages from your terminal
```sh
pip3 install numpy
pip3 install opencv-python
pip3 install Pillow
```

Then clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Momin-C/Who-Are-You.git
```

Insert sample faces in the images folder, run the ```faces-train.py``` program and then ```faces.py``` to test out the model
